I'm following the [Create your own programming language] (http://nathansuniversity.com/) on Nathan's University. These are my solutions.

I'm using node.js and I'm using one package, pegjs. Install using
`npm install pegjs`, which is the node package for [PEG.js] (http://pegjs.majda.cz). In lieu of installing node, the PEG.js site has an online grammer-to-parser tool that can be used to play around with the grammer and is nice for immediate results. But, the node testing framework is nice too....
